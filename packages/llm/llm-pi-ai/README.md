English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai` is the pi-ai-backed multi-provider adapter for the harness LLM service: one plugin instance owns a dictionary of provider routes, each served through [`@earendil-works/pi-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-ai). A route naming an installed pi-ai provider inherits its endpoint, wire protocol, and model catalog as defaults; a route pi-ai does not ship is declared outright, so an OpenAI-compatible gateway or self-hosted server is configuration, not a code change. Profiles and credentials resolve per request over the optional settings and credential seams, so editing the user settings document changes the next request without a restart. A provider that ships a login can be signed into through the harness authorization seam, and the stored sign-in — an OAuth grant, or a key typed into pi-ai's own login prompt — authenticates its route and refreshes itself under the store's cross-process lock. The plugin can mount dormant with zero routes and activate them the moment a settings section supplies profiles.

## Table of Contents

<<<<<<< HEAD
Configure credentials, the model catalog, and deployment-specific transport settings per provider, keyed by the provider route itself. Each profile may set a `retryPolicy`; omission uses normal mode with ten retries in two delay phases. `apiKeyEnv` is a credential *reference* resolved per request, so no secret enters this file. Omitting it leaves the route unauthenticated, which for an installed catalog route means pi-ai's provider-native ambient discovery; a configured reference that resolves to nothing fails the request with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL` instead, because falling through would authenticate with whatever unrelated key the environment happens to hold. One credential serves every model on its route.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin when a composition routes model requests through pi-ai's provider catalogs or through gateways that pi-ai's installed catalog does not describe. The `providers` dictionary is the whole configuration surface: each key is the provider route name a request selects with `GenerateOptions.provider`.

### When to choose it

Choose this adapter when the same composition serves several providers, when a route needs pi-ai's catalog defaults with a few fields corrected, or when a hand-declared gateway must be reached through its own endpoint and protocol. Choose `dsh-llm-deepseek` for the direct DeepSeek route when the deployment needs no other provider. Both adapters can be mounted together because their route names do not collide; registering a route another adapter already owns fails plugin loading.

### Configure provider routes

Each profile may set a `retryPolicy`; omission uses normal mode with five retries. `apiKeyEnv` is a credential reference resolved per request through the harness credential seam, so no secret enters the configuration file; a reference that resolves to nothing fails the request with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL`. Omitting it leaves the route configured-but-keyless, which for an installed catalog route defers to pi-ai's provider-native ambient discovery.

### Sign in to a provider

A provider pi-ai ships a login for can be signed into through the harness authorization seam: the flow offers OAuth or an interactive key prompt (a key is typed into pi-ai's own login prompt, not into the settings form), and the resulting credential is stored in the harness credential store at `llm-pi-ai/<provider id>`. The stored sign-in authenticates its route beneath any `apiKeyEnv` override and refreshes itself under the store's cross-process lock; signing out deletes the stored record. A hand-declared route key outside the record grammar — a lowercase hyphenated identifier — cannot be signed into, because a record write for it refuses with `LlmError('UNSTORABLE_PROVIDER_ID')`; such a route authenticates through `apiKeyEnv` or ambient provider settings instead.

### Resolve the model catalog

A profile's `models` list replaces the route's installed catalog rather than extending it; each entry defaults its unset fields from the installed model of the same id, so narrowing a route to two models, correcting one capacity, or adding a model newer than the installed catalog are one-line edits. `modelOverrides` reshapes individual installed-catalog models without that cost — correct one model, keep the other thirty-seven — and is refused when set beside a `models` list, on a hand-declared route, or naming a model the catalog does not describe, because a silently unchanged model would be a typo someone hunts for later.

### Run with reasoning and wire compatibility

`reasoningEfforts` declares a model's selectable thinking levels: each key is a level selectors offer, its value the spelling dispatch sends on the wire, so `max: ultra` renames a level for a gateway with its own vocabulary. Omitting the field keeps the installed catalog entry's capability; `false` declares a non-reasoning model. `compat` switches reshape the request for endpoints pi-ai cannot recognize — which role carries the system prompt, which field caps output, how a thinking level travels — configurable per route and per model. A model neither the entry nor the installed catalog sizes takes the route's `defaultContextWindow` and `defaultMaxTokens` fallbacks.

### Change configuration at runtime

Profiles are re-read once per operation through the optional settings seam: the base and the user's `llm-pi-ai:` settings section merge per provider, so a user can add a route, override one field of a composition route, or point a route at another proxy, all effective on the next request with no restart. A section the adapter could not serve is refused where it is written — `settings.mutate` answers `settings-rejected` — and a stored section that later fails keeps the namespace's last good value. When the route set or a route's retry policy changes, the plugin re-registers atomically: a conflicting route leaves the previous routes serving.

### Discover models from endpoints

The plugin answers "which models can this provider serve?" for a route a configuration surface is editing or drafting. A route the installed catalog ships is answered from that catalog with no network call; only a route the catalog does not describe is interrogated over the wire (`openai-completions` and `openai-responses` shapes). The reply is candidate metadata a surface may offer for adoption — nothing is stored, and `settings.yaml` remains the only thing that decides what a route serves.

### Failures and recovery

A route pi-ai does not ship needs `api`, `baseURL`, and a non-empty `models` list; an unserviceable profile is refused where it is written, naming the route and model. Failures carry stable codes: a credential that cannot be used fails with `INVALID_CREDENTIAL` naming the route and reference, a route whose `apiKeyEnv` reference resolves to nothing fails with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL`, an unconfigured model fails with `UNKNOWN_MODEL`, and terminal provider failures distinguish `QUOTA` from transient `RATE_LIMIT`. `GenerateOptions.stop` is rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_OPTION` because pi-ai's common streaming UI cannot guarantee it across providers.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Resolution still fails loud, naming the offending route and model, when a route cannot be served at all: a route the catalog does not ship needs `baseURL` and a non-empty `models` list of uniquely-identified models. That resolution runs inside the section schema, so an unserviceable profile is refused **where it is written** — `settings.mutate` answers `settings-rejected` naming the route and model — rather than being stored and then quietly disabling every route in the namespace. The settings seam keeps a namespace's last good value for an already-stored section that fails, so this cannot strand a deployment. `api` accepts the protocols in `supportedProtocols()`; naming it pins every model on the route. A model absent from both catalogs still resolves a wire protocol without restating anything: route choice → that id's installed-catalog or identity answer → what every shipped model on the route agrees on → the nearest preceding sibling the catalogs describe → the OpenAI-compatible gateway default (`openai-completions`), which is the same assumption endpoint interrogation probes with. A provider's newest release adopted from its own listing therefore serves immediately, while a hand-declared route whose models resolve to disagreeing protocols must name `api`, because provider construction binds one implementation per route.

`baseURL` sets the endpoint of every model on the route, so private proxies such as `https://proxy.example.com:8443` remain supported. A catalog route that omits it keeps each catalog model's own endpoint; an id neither that model's entry nor the provider entry describes — a release adopted from the endpoint's live listing — serves at the API mount its installed siblings declare: their shortest version-carrying spelling, mounted at `/v1` for the two OpenAI-shaped protocols when every recorded spelling lacks a version, since those clients take the base verbatim. A provider-declared or route-configured `baseURL` is taken verbatim. Naming `api` on a catalog route repoints the whole route at that protocol, which is how a deployment moves a provider between, say, Responses and Chat Completions.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design behind the adapter; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design philosophy

The adapter is built on immutable snapshots and per-operation resolution. Each operation captures a whole snapshot — the profiles plus a `createModels()` collection holding the `Provider` each route built — before its first `await`, and a configuration change builds a new collection rather than mutating the one in use, so a request that started under one configuration never finishes under another. A route's own credential reference resolves through the harness seam and rides as the request's `apiKey` option, which pi-ai treats as the highest-priority auth override — that is what keeps the fail-loud reference semantics. Everything that override does not cover reaches pi-ai through the collection's own auth: the credential store holds the records a login wrote and a refresh rotates (addressed as `llm-pi-ai/<provider id>`), and the auth context answers the ambient questions a provider asks while resolving. Both are stable across snapshots, so a configuration change rebuilds the collection without forgetting who is signed in.

| [`src/replay.ts`](src/replay.ts) | Versioned `ReplayEnvelope` storage and validation |
| [`src/discovery.ts`](src/discovery.ts) | Endpoint interrogation for configuration surfaces |

### Registration and directory

<<<<<<< HEAD
Supported profile fields are `apiKeyEnv`, `displayName`, `api`, `baseURL`, `models`, `modelOverrides`, `compat`, `defaultContextWindow`, `defaultMaxTokens`, `defaultInput`, `headers`, `reasoning`, `thinkingBudgets`, `cacheRetention`, `transport`, `timeoutMs`, `websocketConnectTimeoutMs`, `streamIdleTimeoutMs`, `maxRequestImageBytes`, `replayMode`, and `retryPolicy`. `replayMode` defaults to `native`; `portable` converts assistant history to provider-neutral content and omits response ids and native block signatures. Each profile's retry policy is captured with that provider route; omission uses ten bounded transient retries in two delay phases. The HTTP request timeout and stream-idle interval are positive finite Node timer delays and both default to one minute; idle time covers only an outstanding provider read, not consumer think time. `maxRequestImageBytes` bounds one request's base64 image payload (default 20 MiB); the oldest images are replaced by text placeholders until an oversized request fits. Harness app attribution wins a conflicting configured header name.
=======
The plugin declares every installed catalog provider it can authenticate in the configurable-provider directory, joined with every route the current profiles declare, so configuration surfaces can offer the full catalog before any route exists. Each entry carries `declared` — whether pi-ai ships nothing under that key — because only the adapter can distinguish a hand-declared route from a narrowed catalog route. Route registration is atomic: a candidate set that collides with another adapter leaves the previous routes serving. A bare mount with zero routes is the dormant posture: nothing registers until a settings section supplies profiles, and routes drop when it empties.
>>>>>>> upstream/master

### Replay and vocabulary

Successful assistant responses store a versioned, lossless-JSON replay state beside the provider and model that produced them — response-level facts plus one per-block entry per streamed block. At request time, `LlmRuntime` passes replay state only when the same adapter instance owns both routes; the adapter validates it and restores native response ids and provider signatures, degrading an unusable state to provider-neutral content instead of failing the request. pi-ai tool-call arguments are parsed objects, so the adapter parses input and re-stringifies output to the harness raw-JSON convention; pi-ai in-stream error events map to terminal `finish` chunks.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the package-level contract is not enough. They move from the service contract to the twin adapter and the shared types.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Most listings disclose an id and nothing else; `context_window`/`context_length` and `max_output_tokens`/`max_tokens` are read when a gateway supplies them, entries without a usable id are skipped rather than failing the whole listing, and everything else the adopting surface still owes. Each candidate also carries whatever the reference catalogs know about that exact id: accepted input modalities and reasoning levels from the installed pi-ai catalog first, then the shared identity catalog, plus a `catalogMatched` marker answering whether any catalog described it. A configuration surface shows these as badges and writes image capability onto the adopted row; reasoning stays resolution-owned, because its wire spellings are adapter vocabulary. An id neither catalog describes adopts cleanly anyway — resolution falls back to the route's own protocol facts (see Catalog resolution) — so an unlisted model is selectable the moment the endpoint lists it. The reply is read under a four-megabyte ceiling enforced on the bytes actually received — the endpoint is a URL the user typed, so a declared length is checked first but never trusted as the bound. An unreachable endpoint, a refused credential, a non-JSON body, and a body with no `data` array all fail with `DISCOVERY_FAILED` and a message naming the endpoint and, for a 401 or 403 alone, the credential. Cancellation during the body read surfaces as `ABORTED`, like a cancellation before the request went out.

## Provider/model routing and replay

Each resolution produces one **immutable** snapshot — the profiles plus a `createModels()` collection holding the `Provider` each route built — and every operation captures a whole snapshot before its first `await`. A configuration change builds a *new* collection rather than mutating the one in use: `Models.streamSimple()` resolves its provider lazily, when the stream is first consumed, which is after the credential await, so a mutated collection would let a request that started under one configuration finish under another or fail on a provider that no longer exists. This is what makes the seam's per-step call freeze (`llm.prepareCall()`) hold end to end — switching models mid-reply takes effect on the next step, never inside the one in flight. Requests reach their provider through `Models.streamSimple()`. A catalog route that keeps its catalog protocol **reuses** the installed provider with its model list replaced, because that provider owns API implementations this package cannot reconstruct — Bedrock loads its Smithy module through a separate entry point — so rebuilding it from parts would silently narrow which providers work. Every other route is built by `createProvider()` over the protocol table behind `supportedProtocols()`, whose entries are the same factories pi-ai's own provider factories use.

Credentials never enter that collection. The harness resolves a route's key through its own seam before the request reaches pi-ai and passes it as the request's `apiKey` option, which pi-ai treats as the highest-priority auth override; `Models` therefore holds no credential store, and the harness keeps its fail-loud reference semantics. A route naming no credential resolves as configured-but-keyless and leaves the requirement to the protocol, which is where it actually lives.

The selected model descriptor supplies the protocol implementation. This includes native API differences such as OpenAI models whose descriptor uses the Responses API rather than Chat Completions; the harness adapter does not hardcode endpoint selection by model name.

Successful assistant responses store a versioned, lossless-JSON replay state beside the provider and model that produced them, as a `ReplayEnvelope`: a response-level half (kind, version, API, route, response ids, native stop reason) plus one per-block entry per streamed block carrying that block's signatures. The per-block alignment is what `BlockAssembler` prunes when assembly drops a block (a `max-tokens` tool call), so the stored entries always describe the stored content — the retained blocks keep their signatures. At request time, `LlmRuntime` passes replay state only when the historical provider route and target provider route are currently owned by this same `PiAiAdapter` instance. The adapter validates the state and restores pi-ai response ids and provider signatures even when the target provider or model changes; pi-ai then decides which metadata its target API can reuse. History without replay state is translated as foreign provider-neutral content and never impersonates a native pi-ai response.

Durable content is the authoritative record; replay state only restores native fidelity. A stored state this build cannot use — another adapter's kind, another version (including the flat pre-envelope form older logs carry), malformed metadata, provider/model mismatches between the message and replay state, or content/block mismatches — degrades that one assistant message to the same foreign provider-neutral conversion instead of failing the request, and the plugin logs the `INVALID_REPLAY_STATE` diagnostic through its `onReplayDegrade` hook.

## Vocabulary differences

- pi-ai tool-call arguments are parsed objects; the harness stores raw JSON strings. The adapter parses input and re-stringifies output.
- pi-ai reports failures as in-stream error events; these map to `finish {kind:'error'|'aborted', failure}` chunks. Provider-specific error text distinguishes terminal `QUOTA` from transient `RATE_LIMIT` and `SERVER`, including gateways that report `upstream_unavailable` under HTTP 400, while an HTML gateway error is reduced to its HTTP status and title instead of being displayed as a document. Text and usage signals evaluated against the resolved model's context window normalize overflow to `CONTEXT_WINDOW_EXCEEDED`. A terminal `stop` whose message carries no content blocks maps to a `finish {kind:'error'}` with code `EMPTY_RESPONSE` (retried by default policy) instead of a successful empty message.
- pi-ai folds reasoning tokens into output usage; there is no separate reasoning count to map.
- pi-ai's `off` thinking level crosses the Harness capability seam unchanged and becomes an omitted pi-ai common `reasoning` option at dispatch.
- `GenerateOptions.stop` is rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_OPTION` because pi-ai's common streaming UI cannot guarantee it across providers.

## App attribution

Every request carries the shared attribution header from dsh-llm's `attributionHeaders()`, merged through pi-ai's `headers` stream option. Provider-specific app-attribution headers are not synthesized. See [dsh-llm § App attribution](../llm/README.md#app-attribution-attributionts).

## Dependency weight

pi-ai installs several provider SDKs and lazy-loads the one selected by the catalog model. The dependency weight is isolated to this opt-in adapter package.
=======
- [dsh-llm service](../llm/README.md) — the provider-neutral service this adapter registers on.
- [llm-deepseek adapter](../llm-deepseek/README.md) — the direct DeepSeek twin for the `deepseek-official` route.
- [LLM streaming subsystem](../../../docs/subsystems/llm-streaming.md) — the `StreamChunk` protocol and adapter contract.
- [llm-retry](../llm-retry/README.md) — the retry executor that applies each profile's `retryPolicy`.
- [Twin LLM adapters](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-13-twin-llm-adapters.md) — why the DeepSeek route ships two structurally different adapters.
- [Generated configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-llm-pi-ai) — every accepted config field and its source declaration.

## Model Experience

### Provider request through pi-ai

#### What the model sees

The selected catalog model receives `GenerateOptions.system`, history, tools, and sampling fields supported by pi-ai's common streaming API. Each retained image is preceded by text naming its complete attachment id and actual request dimensions. When the current execution filesystem maps the attachment provider's host object, the text also carries a read-only normalized-object path and warns that normalization or request projection may have resized or re-encoded the upload. When accumulated base64 image payload exceeds the route's `maxRequestImageBytes`, each offloaded image keeps its own identity and currently resolved access in replacement text. Offloaded normalized attachments are not read or transformed. Provider-native replay metadata is restored only when the adapter validates it for the historical content.

#### Token effect

Provider tokenization governs exact input. Retained images add the stable attachment and coordinate descriptor; the offload placeholder replaces an omitted image's visual tokens. Replay metadata may let a native API reuse provider-side state.

#### KV Cache effect

Conversion preserves logical request order, while image handles and offload placeholders add model-visible text. A changed execution-world path rewrites a historical handle and can prevent reuse from that image even when attachment identity and request bytes stay stable. Changing adapter instance, provider, model, or another upstream token has the same suffix effect. Crossing the image bound replaces an earlier image with placeholder text, so reuse ends at that message until the offloaded prefix stabilizes.

### Provider response

#### What the model sees

pi-ai events become harness reasoning, text, tool-call, usage, and finish chunks. The adapter passes parsed tool arguments to the harness as raw JSON strings.

#### Token effect

Generated content affects later inputs only after the loop records it. pi-ai folds reasoning tokens into output usage when the provider does not report them separately, and preserves its exact `totalTokens` value unchanged.

#### KV Cache effect

Recorded response content appends to the next request and does not invalidate its earlier reusable prefix. Unrecorded transport metadata and usage accounting do not affect cache identity.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define where the adapter stops and future work begins. They are current package constraints, not a general pi-ai comparison or a task backlog.

- **`maxRequestImageBytes` counts base64 image payload only** — text, tools, descriptors, and JSON structure ride outside the bound, so it must sit below the gateway's request-body cap with headroom. Offload is a deterministic request projection and is not recorded as a session event.
- **A sign-in lives only in the process that started it** — an authorization attempt is not durable, so reloading the page mid-login abandons it and the human starts over. Signing out is `deleteRecord` on the stored record, which forgets it locally without telling the issuer.
- **Provider-native discovery answers through this plugin's ambient context** — a route naming no credential defers to the catalog provider's own resolution, which asks for environment values (`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AWS_PROFILE`, and each provider's own set) and for local credential files. Both questions are answered here: the credential seam is consulted before the process environment, and file existence is checked against the host process's filesystem with `~` expanded. What it cannot do is *read* a credential file's contents — a provider that parses `~/.aws/credentials` itself does so directly, outside the seam.
- **Settings can add or override routes, not remove composition routes** — the user layer merges over the composition base, so deleting a `cordis.yml`-provided provider is a composition change.
- **The layered merge has no delete for dict keys** — a `reasoningEfforts` level, `modelOverrides` entry, or `compat` field the base declares can be overridden but not removed by the user layer.
- **`headers` can carry a credential the redactor never sees** — the profile's `headers` dict is plain strings; store credentials as `apiKeyEnv` references.
- **A route's catalog never refreshes itself** — the catalog is whatever `settings.yaml` says; nothing here queries a provider for the models it serves.
- **One wire protocol per route** — a mixed-protocol catalog route cannot host a model of the other protocol; splitting the provider across two route keys is the workaround.
- **A modality declaration is not verified** — a model declaring `image` its gateway does not serve is refused by the provider after prompt admission. The durable image remains in history and the same misdeclared model can fail again; switching to a text-only model remains possible because the shared LLM runtime projects image references into stable text for that request.
- **An unauthenticated route depends on its protocol** — a route naming no credential resolves as configured-but-keyless, but pi-ai's OpenAI-compatible implementation still requires an API key or an `Authorization` header, so a keyless local server needs a placeholder credential referenced by `apiKeyEnv` or an `Authorization` entry in `headers`.
- **`GenerateOptions.stop` is unsupported** — pi-ai's common stream options cannot guarantee stop-sequence behavior across providers.
- **In-history `system` messages use pi-ai's common context conversion** — provider-specific placement follows pi-ai rather than a harness-owned wire override.
- **Provider HTTP status is unavailable** — pi-ai error events do not expose a stable HTTP status across providers.
- **Retry policy is provider-owned, not an SDK retry** — pi-ai SDK retries stay disabled so durable agent steps and `llm/retry` events own every visible attempt, and direct `ctx.llm.stream()` calls remain single-attempt.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

This Dev Note is non-authoritative working context: undecided directions and notes for maintainers. Shipped behavior and accepted rationale live in the sections above, the package code, and the linked Agent Notes.

- The offered protocol set is deliberately narrower than pi-ai's full API set: Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, and Codex authenticate through flows a profile cannot completely describe with a key, an endpoint, and headers; catalog routes still reach them through their own provider, and only an explicit override is refused. Codex is sign-in-able through the authorization flow's OAuth grant.
- The `compat` switch set is pinned to pi-ai's compat types by drift gates; an upstream upgrade that adds a field, gives a further protocol a compat type, or widens a value union fails the build until someone classifies it.
